## Note for Examiners

Instead of rtl folders, we have uploaded our final code onto separate branches depending on the task - please note that the branches supporting reference code programs will also work for the F1 program; the reason for 4 different branches to separate the tasks is due to the differing Instruction Memory files and testbenches for F1 vs Reference. 

The file inside Data Memory.sv that is read will need to be changed manually to output the PDF for the different .mem files (Gaussian, sine, noisy, triangle).

The branches to look at are as follows:

**Single Cycle CPU for F1:**

**Branch: Main**

Folder: test

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Single Cycle CPU for Reference Code:**

**Branch: NonPipelinedReferenceCode**

Description and Contributors: 

Single cycle CPU with additional instructions to support the implementation of the reference code. The basic structure was largely taken from Lab4 work with additional instructions of Jump and Shift done by Bhavya and Riya. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Pipelined CPU for F1 Program:**

**Branch: Working-pipelined-F1**

Description and Contributors: 

Working F1 light sequence machine code on a Pipelined CPU; pipelining structure worked on by Ethan and Isabel, additional changes resulting from debugging and were made by Bhavya and Riya (outlined in MAIN README).

This branch was used to debug the changes made from the Pipeline branches referenced below; these were worked on by Isabel and Ethan to implement the structural changes for pipelining and adding new modules to achieve this. This branch contains that structural basis with further code additions and changes made during the debugging process to resolve errors which were done by Bhavya and Riya.

Only the .vcd file for Gaussian PDF waveform has been uploaded since the other files were too large to upload, however the video files for all the waveforms are on the Google Drive.

## Final Team Achievement: Pipelined CPU which can successfully run the F1 and Reference programs. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Initial Approach

- We began the project by **planning the tasks**, this included understanding the objectives of the task as a team as well as creating and delegating tasks. 
- Once the tasks had been delegated, **machine code** which would implement the f1 light switch was created and checked by other member of the team.
- After the machine code was created we delegated the tasks of **implementing the machine code**, adding new architecture which is needed for the machine code, based on the pre-built blocks in Lab 4. This included planning the additions to the cpu, implementing the changes and then debugging any issues.
- Next, we **implemented the reference code**, this involed adding a load byte and store byte instruction and testing the reference code against our cpu.
- Finally, we pipelined the RISC-V cpu and tested our final design. 


## Planning

### Understanding the Project Brief 

Before doing our separate tasks, we also came together as a team to understand the specification of the project. 
1) We ensured our machine code included a Jump and Link instruction to excute the F1 sequence.
2) We first aimed to complete the F1 program and Reference and then attempt pipeline and cache as challenges.
3) We made sure to include the inputs and outputs to the RISC-V processor below. This include a reset, this resets only the processor to start the program, and is not used to reset counters or a state machine. Addditionally, we implemented a trigger signal used to tell RISC-V when to start the F1 light sequence. **We decided for the trigger signal to be automatic, so thatas soon as the program starts, the F1 light sequence is triggered**.

When splitting the tasks we decided to work in pairs for machine code and implementation, then reference and piplining. This ensured that as indivduals we were not making simple mistakes and were constantly being questioned with each decision we made. This is how the tasks were divided:
- Machine Code - Isabel and Ethan
- Implementation of Machine Code - Riya and Bhavya 
- Reference Code implementation - Riya and Bhavya 
- Pipelining - Isabel and Ethan

## Machine Code - Isabel and Ethan

Instructions:

main:               
    
    addi t1 , zero , 0xff  //t1=11111111
    
    JAL  ra , loop         //jump to the loop

    addi a0 , zero , 0     //when jump back, reset all

    addi s0 , zero , 0
       
loop: 
    
    addi a0 , zero , 0      //initialize output a0=0

    addi s0 , zero , 0      //initialize intermediate s0=0
    
    addi zero , zero , 0    //NOP avoiding Data Hazard
    
    addi zero , zero , 0    //NOP

mloop:
   
    slli s0 , s0 , 1       //first left shift s0 by 1 bit
    
    addi zero , zero , 0   //NOP 
    
    addi zero , zero , 0   //NOP
    
    addi s0 , s0 , 1       //then add s0 by 1
    
    addi zero , zero , 0   //NOP
    
    addi zero , zero , 0   //NOP

    addi a0 , s0 , 0       //preserve s0 as output a0

    addi zero , zero , 0   //NOP
 
    addi zero , zero , 0   //NOP
    
    bne  a0 , t1 , mloop   //if a0 does not equal to 11111111, back to mloop
    
    addi zero , zero , 0   //NOP avoiding Control Hazard
    
    addi zero , zero , 0   //NOP
    
    jalr t2 , ra , 0       //exit and return to the next line after JAL instruction
    
Explaination:

To execute F1 starting light program originated from state diagram, an output a0 is set up to be compared with the originial output of each state. To make it display as 1, 11, 111, etc., an intermediate vairable s0 is set up to fist shift to left by 1 bit, and then be added by 1 so that each cycle, it can result in desired value. Then s0 is assigned to a0, which is used to light the lighting program. 

Branch not equal compares the a0 with the preset value in t1, which is the last state in the state diagram with output 8'b1. When a0 does not equal to 8'b1, it tunrns out that the lighting needs to continue, so it will branch to the mloop to execute the previous steps again. If, after several executions, a0 finally comes to 8'b1, meaning that all lights are displayed, jalr is executed and it jumps to the instrcution after jal, reseting all the registers.

Since we will implement pipeline without hazrd control unit, we will use two NOP instruction when Data and Control Hazard happens. 

    addi s0 , zero , 0
    slli s0 , 0 , 1
    
For example in loop and mloop we repeatedly used s0 in two consecutive lines which means the s0 value has not been written back to register file before we use it again in second line. 

    bne  a0 , t1 , mloop
    jalr t2 , ra , 0

Another example of Control Hazard happens when we want to branch to mloop if condition satisfies. However we have not decided whether the next line will be return or mloop when the second instruction is fetched therefore we need another two NOP to delay next line by two cycles.

## Implementation

From the instructions we already in Lab 4, the additional instructions needed were a shift to implement the light sequence and jump to implement the subroutine. The process for implementing these is outlined below: 

### Data Memory - Riya
As we had not created a Data Memory as an extension in Lab 4, it was added as a task for the coursework. When trying to implement it I began by looking at the RISC-V diagram given in lectures to see the input and output signals driving the Data Memory Module:

<img width="702" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-10 at 11 41 44" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/206853241-c259f26b-9809-438e-953f-8243c735c360.png">

Changes needed for Data Memory:

**Creation of Data Memory module** - In order to create the Data memory module I refered to the final RISC-V diagram. The inputs to the module were the data memory address (ALUout), the write data, write enable, clock, ALUout and read data. 

**Data Memory Address**- The Data Memory address consisted of 32 bits from the ALUout. The ALUout is the addition of rst1 and Immidient sign extended. 

**Write Enable**- According to the RISC-V diagram the write enable comes from a signal within the control unit called MemWrite. I created logic within the control unit to set Memwrite to high if the opcode of the instruction was for a store instruction, as this would require writing to the memory.

**Write Data**- This will take in the data value that will be written into the data memory address if write enable is high (you are implementing a store instruction). Write Data is driven by the value of rst2 from the value within RD2. 

**Clock**- Simillar to the register file, the data memory is clocked. This is important as it avoids writing to an address with trying to read from it, so it is essential that it is clocked logic.

**Read Data**- This would be the output of the Data Memory that gets stored into a register in the regfile (through the regfile write data). The Read data would take the value stored in the data memory from ALUout and only ouput this value into the regfile if Resultsrc signal was high. This signal would be set to high if the opcode for a load was read from the instruction. A mux in the ALU.sv top level module would then select between the ALUout value or the Read Data value depending on if Resultsrc is high. 

Data Memory Module:

Control Unit signals:

<img width="230" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-11 at 12 49 05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/206904500-1d37ea1b-20be-4251-a516-f166fcc75784.png">

Top Level ALU mux:

In the top level ALU i included the logic for the mux, this will load the read data into the register file if a load instruction is detected (ResultSrc is high), else it will simply output ALUout. 

Testing:

In order to test the load and store word instructions, I first had to understand the instruction format. As load and store are register addressed I had to load values into a register using an addi instruction. Then I stored that value into a data memory location, sw t1 0(t2). This stored the value with register t1 (0x001 from previous addi instruction) into the data memory address 0(t2), this means the value in register t2+0 offset so that would store in data memory location 0x1000 from previous addi instruction. In was important that i only accessed memory from the allowed range of data memory addresses from the project brief. 


**Creating Test Machine Code**- 

<img width="310" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-11 at 12 36 58" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/206903955-2511d995-40f7-4358-8edf-4eab3ec93772.png">

**Output**- 

The output was 0x001 into a0 which was as expected proving the lw and sw instruction worked.

<img width="526" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-11 at 12 37 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/206903968-30cd4bf0-a8a6-4c4b-aa8c-ae1ee53187ce.png">

### Shift - Riya 
When creating the shift I made an orirginal version, which consisted of adding an additional module which would take RD1 into a shift module, and if shift select was high then RD1 would be shifted to the left by one bit. The diagram and implementation of the final version of shift is shown below:

For our F1 machine code we used a slli instruction which was a logical shift left, in order to implement this orginallly I added the shift instruction to the control signal, so that for the shift opcode and function 3 a shift select would be set high which would set a multiplexer at the end of the cpu to the value in RD1 concanticated one bit to the left.

**Final version:**
The final version involed setting ALUctrl in s shift operation to 001 so that the shift can be implemented inside the ALU module.

Control Unit:

<img width="265" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 13 26 21" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207607342-1b7eec38-041a-4b77-b00f-f64b46fada1c.png">

ALU module:

<img width="322" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 13 26 40" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207607411-6416d5a6-537a-430e-8a3a-38ffc78ad610.png">

- Ultilizes the fact that there are free bits in ALUctrl to implement a shift instruction inside the ALU module.
- No changes required to architecture as shift occurs in ALU.
- As we use the shift operator we can shift by different amounts using Immop.

**Testing:**

I created simple machine code to load the value 0xFF into s0 and then shift the value left by 1 simillar to the shifts in our F1 machine code:

<img width="279" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 13 38 36" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207609911-9e457f30-ad90-4579-a3b3-ae5daaebb3f9.png">

**Output:**

The ouput resulted in a0 outputting a value of 0xFF shifted by 1 with a 0 last bit, as expected, proving the slli shift instruction now worked.

<img width="688" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 13 39 55" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207610175-908ba567-748c-4df3-916c-630dc6e71d46.png">

### Jump - Bhavya

I added relevant signals to the control unit for a JAL and RET implemented as a JALR with rd set as x0 since it is not necessary to store the value of the register: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107200668/208125458-9a65af0d-fced-4cb4-8e6d-5c812943ab85.png)

Since at this point we had 2 combinational loops the RegWrite was being set back down to low in the default case of the second loop. Hence, a signal jregen was added to set it equal to RegWrite so that if a JAL was taking place, the RegWrite doesn't get defaulted back to low: 

NB: refer to Control Unit.sv inside Jump branch

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107200668/208122208-1b225ad6-6448-4c6e-8cd3-4ce0dd8a98ad.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107200668/208122230-4f1e2022-6c08-43ed-a176-0956e9e3c118.png)

There were further iterations of the control unit to put the signals affected by EQ outside the combinational loop as a special case and then put the 2 separate combinational loops into 1, which then removed the need for this signal - this was done within the Merge Jump and Shift Branch. 

Other changes made were adding mutliplexers to the PC and ALU (regfile) unit to control what was being written to the register (PC + 4) and to the PC (PC + Imm) under the right conditions by using appropriate enable signals (elaborated upon in personal statement). 

### Merging Jump and Shift

Once the new arcitecture for data memory, jump and shift were created on separate branches we then had to merge all the branches together. This included the following changes:

1) We decided to change the format of the sign extension module to better match the instructions. Inside of labelling the extention by instruction we labelled them by instruction type. This was implemented after realising the sign extend for store was wrong and that Jalr and addi should have the same sign extend as they were boh type I instructions.

<img width="998" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 17 12 59" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207662203-13b204ae-0880-4d8d-ba20-571a7436636e.png">

2) Next, we added the Jump logic to set PCSrc high inside the control unit. 

<img width="353" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 16 52 29" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207657793-dea2a320-9ca8-4c67-8de6-23b1afa3db2b.png">

3) We also added the Data Memory module to the top level and connected it into the cpu at the end of the diagram. 

<img width="149" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 16 52 39" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207657840-756ca4d2-8097-44b7-b9eb-893f681bb747.png">

4) Finally, in order to test we added a vbdBar function into our test bench to record the F1 light sequence on the LED's. 

<img width="109" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 16 52 54" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207657901-a9522942-7ceb-4962-9399-b3c52a1e34f9.png">

**Testing**

In order to test the F1 light sequence cpu, we ran the machine code (shown in above section) and analysed the gtkwave output. Once we were happy with the waveforms generated, we added the vbdBar function and saw the correct leight sequence on the Vbuddy. The LED's went up from 1 to 11111111 and then back to zero, as we were expecting. 

<img width="769" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 17 21 01" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207663885-e1881895-b64a-4a49-9de8-7a6443d2d550.png">

## Additional implementations for Reference Program - Bhavya and Riya

Since the reference code included Load Byte Unsigned and Store Byte instructions we needed to add these in since we had only implemented Load Word and Store Word earlier. 
This meant that we needed to enable byte addressing within data memory as evidenced below. The main changes required were the width parameters within the module and setting the least significant byte of the register value equal to a specific byte instead of a word. In the case of load word, the changes made were to concatenate individual bytes to form a word.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107200668/207978996-6bba8f5b-2b28-4ebd-99cb-3b1dbdd23fdd.png)

There was also an additional signal added taking the bits of funct3 from the control unit outlined above as ‘funct3_LS’ to help distinguish between a loading or storing a byte or word respectively as that was the main difference noted in the instruction format between the byte/word versions. LD_EN is also set by a control unit signal of ResultSrc (initially 1 bit and HIGH when load instruction). 
Since the load byte was specified to be unsigned, this meant that it would need to be zero extended before being put in the register: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107200668/207979090-312dd46f-18cc-422f-98a1-9d29ee4881fa.png)

The explanation regarding design choices on selecting a specific byte from the instruction format and selecting bytes to form a word are outlined in  the individual  self-reflection account in README_Bhavya.md file. 

Created a small section of machine code to test individual instructions: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107200668/208207997-c70b382d-bd46-4eaa-b058-afba8cdf1c30.png)

GtkWave outputs:

**Implementing Add instruction:**

1) We added it to the control unit:

<img width="196" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 16 56 18" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207921178-b21b659e-dbc8-4dfa-8982-fc170fc559c7.png">

Implementing LUI instruction:

1) We needed to add the instruction to the control unit, adding an additional signal called LUI_EN:

<img width="498" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 16 55 58" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207921088-5bb22053-da5d-4e79-ac8f-21b34ed9ac91.png">

2) LUI_EN was fed into the RegFile.sv module, and used to either feed through ImmOP from the sign extend into a register or if theres no LUI instruction then feed through write data:

<img width="605" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 16 55 35" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115703122/207920982-6fe32901-d5bb-440a-a1eb-898eebdbc6ab.png">

## Pipelining - Ethan and Isabel

![3901671112433_ pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69693952/207876411-630165c6-5249-4d3d-bbbc-494151a4d382.jpg)

Pipelining was divided into two parts, firstly we created **four individual pipeline registers**, as shown on the diagram. On each clock cycle, signals move from stage to stage with the same purpose but different instructions. They are distinguished by different suffixes, e.g. D, E, to indicate which stage the signal has reached. In modules, the output signals are given with the input signals synchronously on rising edge of the CLK. In pipe2, control unit was kept the same except that all the control signals are also be pipelined, to arrive in synchrony to the datapath. This ensures that control signals can travel with the data, providing the correct signal to control each stage.

After completing the registers, the **five stages** were creating as top level modules with all blocks and pipeline registers inserted.

In the first fetch stage, we moveed the adder and multiplexer from execute stage with inputs PCE, ImmExtE, ALUout from datapath since they are combinational logic. This indicates whether the next instruction is branched, jumped or returned.

<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-13 1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69693952/207877364-756c3478-1979-444a-872e-34bfd6e2bed4.png">

We also have slight changes on control path. Rather than implementing AND, OR gates, we have combined branch and jump select inside the control unit with an EQ input to a single PCsrc output. PCsrc then is used to indicate the next Program address. A seperated jalrsel is added in the control unit which go along with the control path and is used in execute stage to choose PCE + ImmExtE if it is jalr instruction.

We have noticed that we need to change the posedge clk to negedge while writing register file. This is because in order to make it efficient we do not want to add another pipeline register with register file and we can simply write data at negative clock edge.

There was a change in Write back stage multiplexer as well. Our ResultSrc was only one bit originally therefore we tried to implement two multiplexers with one bit selects: jalsel and Resultsrc as following image.

Most of the errors were repeated errors which were mentioned above and any further changes needed to fix the few errors are outlined in the Debugging section below. 

*Hazard*:

To avoid pipelining hazard, instead of adding hazard unit, we chose to add NOP instructions to ensure that register values have already be written back to register file, and the next instruction has been decided (in **Branch** situation). This is shown in detail in **Machine Code Explaination** previously.

## Pipelining Debugging and Combining with Reference Code - Riya and Bhavya 

During debugging we noticed whilst analysing gtkwave that further NOPs would be required; thus we made a slight change to the machine code outlined at the start to have 5 NOPs between every instruction rather than 2 shown below. 

Summary of changes made during debugging: 
- Moving jump logic and multiplexers to execute stage
- Separating branch and jump enable signals to match diagram from lecture slides (2nd diagram below).
- LUI_EN signals needed to be delayed appropriately using flip flops which were added in, to align with register values changing in specific cycles and avoid hazards.
- For reference program only: break statement to stop plotting after a certain range (to speed up compiling) from single cycle testbench was removed since pipelining needs more cycles we did not want to stop plotting after the certain value was reached; it was better to remove the statement so the waveform could be plotted entirely.
